Things to tweak for performance increases:
  Elasticity thresholds
  Cache size and object size thresholds
  Nature of the workload to make more favorable to caching
  Blocking vs. nonblocking communication
  Redirection and sleep timing, including select() - Make use of a
    negative value from gettime() to compare against.
